                    <p>Woodpeckers include the tiny piculets, the smallest of which appears to be the bar-breasted
                        piculet at 7.5 cm (3.0 in) in length and a weight of 8.9 g (0.31 oz).[2][3] Some of the largest
                        woodpeckers can be more than 50 cm (20 in) in length. The largest surviving species is the great
                        slaty woodpecker, which weighs 430 g (15 oz) on average and up to 563 g (19.9 oz), and measures
                        45 to 55 cm (18 to 22 in), but the extinct imperial woodpecker, at 55 to 61 cm (22 to 24 in),
                        and ivory-billed woodpecker, around 48 to 53 cm (19 to 21 in) and 516 g (18.2 oz), were probably
                        both larger.[4][3][5][6][7]</p>

                    <p>conspicuous. The colours of many species are based on olive and brown and some are pied,
                        suggesting a need for camouflage; others are boldly patterned in black, white, and red, and many
                        have a crest or tufted feathers on their crowns. Woodpeckers tend to be sexually dimorphic, but
                        differences between the sexes are generally small; exceptions to this are Williamson's sapsucker
                        and the orange-backed woodpecker, which differ markedly. The plumage is moulted fully once a
                        year apart from the wrynecks, which have an additional partial moult before breeding.[8]

                        Woodpeckers, piculets, and wrynecks all possess characteristic zygodactyl feet, consisting of
                        four toes, the first (hallux) and the fourth facing backward and the second and third facing
                        forward. This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees. Members of
                        this family can walk vertically up tree trunks, which is beneficial for activities such as
                        foraging for food or nest excavation. In addition to their strong claws and feet, woodpeckers
                        have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. Exceptions
                        are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, which have
                        only three toes on each foot. The tails of all woodpeckers, except the piculets and wrynecks,
                        are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together
                        to support it.[4]

                        Woodpeckers have strong bills that they use for drilling and drumming on trees, and long, sticky
                        tongues for extracting food (insects and larvae).[4] Woodpecker bills are typically longer,
                        sharper, and stronger than the bills of piculets and wrynecks, but their morphology is very
                        similar. The bill's chisel-like tip is kept sharp by the pecking action in birds that regularly
                        use it on wood. The beak consists of three layers; an outer sheath called rhamphotheca, made of
                        scales formed from keratin proteins, an inner layer of bone which has a large cavity and
                        mineralised collagen fibers, and a middle layer made of porous bone which connects the two other
                        layers.

                        Furthermore, the tongue bone (or hyoid bone) of the woodpecker is very long, and winds around
                        the skull through a special cavity, thereby cushioning the brain.[9] Combined, this anatomy
                        helps the beak absorb mechanical stress.[10] Species of woodpecker and flicker that use their
                        bills in soil or for probing as opposed to regular hammering tend to have longer and more
                        decurved bills. Due to their smaller bill size, many piculets and wrynecks forage in decaying
                        wood more often than woodpeckers. Their long, sticky tongues, which possess barbs, aid these
                        birds in grabbing and extracting insects from deep within a hole in a tree. The tongue was
                        reported to be used to spear grubs, but more detailed studies published in 2004 have shown that
                        the tongue instead wraps around the prey before being pulled out.[11]

                    <p>Many of the foraging, breeding, and signaling behaviors of woodpeckers involve drumming and
                        hammering using their bills.[12] To prevent brain damage from the rapid and repeated powerful
                        impacts, woodpeckers have a number of physical features that protect their brains.[13] These
                        include a relatively small and smooth brain, narrow subdural space, little cerebrospinal fluid
                        surrounding it to prevent it from moving back and forth inside the skull during pecking, the
                        orientation of the brain within the skull (which maximises the contact area between the brain
                        and the skull) and the short duration of contact. The skull consists of strong but compressible,
                        sponge-like bone, which is most concentrated in the forehead and the back of the skull.[13]
                        Another anatomical adaptation of woodpeckers is the enormously elongated hyoid bone which
                        subdivides, passes on either side of the spinal column and wraps around the brain case, before
                        ending in the right nostril cavity. It plays the role of safety-belt.[9]

                        Computer simulations have shown that 99.7% of the energy generated in pecking is stored in the
                        form of strain energy, which is distributed throughout the bird's body, with only a small
                        remaining fraction of the energy going into the brain. The pecking also causes the woodpecker's
                        skull to heat up, which is part of the reason why they often peck in short bursts with brief
                        breaks in between, giving the head some time to cool.[14] During the millisecond before contact
                        with wood, a thickened nictitating membrane closes, protecting the eye from flying debris.[15]
                        These membranes also prevent the retina from tearing. Their nostrils are also protected; they
                        are often slit-like and have special feathers to cover them. Woodpeckers are capable of repeated
                        pecking on a tree at high decelerations on the order of 10,000 m/s2 (33,000 ft/s2) (1000 g).[12]

                        Some large woodpeckers such as Dryocopus have a fast, direct form of flight, but the majority of
                        species have a typical undulating flight pattern consisting of a series of rapid flaps followed
                        by a swooping glide. Many birds in the genus Melanerpes have distinctive, rowing wing-strokes
                        while the piculets engage in short bursts of rapid direct flight.[16]</p>

                        </h2><br>
                        <h3>Global distribution
                        </h3><br>
                        <p>Woodpeckers have a mostly cosmopolitan distribution, although they are absent from
                            Australasia, Madagascar, and Antarctica. They are also absent from some of the world's
                            oceanic islands, although many insular species are found on continental islands. The true
                            woodpeckers, subfamily Picinae, are distributed across the entire range of the family. The
                            Picumninae piculets have a pantropical distribution, with species in Southeast Asia, Africa,
                            and the Neotropics, with the greatest diversity being in South America.[17] The second
                            piculet subfamily, the Sasiinae, contains the African piculet and two species in the genus
                            Sasia that are found in Southeast Asia.[18] The wrynecks (Jynginae) are found exclusively in
                            the Old World, with the two species occurring in Europe, Asia, and Africa.[17]

                            Most woodpeckers are sedentary, but a few examples of migratory species are known, such as
                            the rufous-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker,[17] and Eurasian wryneck, which
                            breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the Sahel in Africa in the winter.[19] More
                            northerly populations of Lewis's woodpecker, northern flicker, Williamson's sapsucker,
                            red-breasted sapsucker, and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in the fall in North
                            America.[17] Most woodpecker movements can be described as dispersive, such as when young
                            birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions.
                            Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped pygmy woodpecker,
                            which moves to lowlands from hills during winter. The woodpeckers that do migrate, do so
                            during the day</p>

                            <h3>Habitat requirements</h3>
                            <p>
                                Overall, woodpeckers are arboreal birds of wooded habitats. They reach their greatest
                                diversity in tropical rainforests, but occur in almost all suitable habitats, including
                                woodlands, savannahs, scrublands, and bamboo forests. Even grasslands and deserts have
                                been
                                colonised by various species. These habitats are more easily occupied where a small
                                number
                                of trees exist, or in the case of desert species like the Gila woodpecker, tall cacti
                                are
                                available for nesting.[20] Some are specialists and are associated with coniferous or
                                deciduous woodlands, or even, like the acorn woodpecker, with individual tree genera
                                (oaks
                                in this case). Other species are generalists and are able to adapt to forest clearance
                                by
                                exploiting secondary growth, plantations, orchards, and parks. In general,
                                forest-dwelling
                                species need rotting or dead wood on which to forage.[21]

                                Several species are adapted to spending a portion of their time feeding on the ground,
                                and a
                                very small minority have abandoned trees entirely and nest in holes in the ground. The
                                ground woodpecker is one such species, inhabiting the rocky and grassy hills of South
                                Africa,[22] and the Andean flicker is another.[21]

                                The Swiss Ornithological Institute has set up a monitoring program to record breeding
                                populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat
                                requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted
                                woodpecker,
                                lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker, and Eurasian three-toed
                                woodpecker.
                                Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts from 1990 to 2008. During
                                this
                                period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed
                                woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and
                                middle-spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood is likely to be the
                                major
                                factor explaining the population increase of these species.[23]

                            <p>Most woodpeckers live solitary lives, but their behavior ranges from highly antisocial
                                species that are aggressive towards their own kind, to species that live in groups.
                                Solitary
                                species defend such feeding resources as a termite colony or fruit-laden tree, driving
                                away
                                other conspecifics and returning frequently until the resource is exhausted. Aggressive
                                behaviors include bill pointing and jabbing, head shaking, wing flicking, chasing,
                                drumming,
                                and vocalizations. Ritual actions do not usually result in contact, and birds may
                                "freeze"
                                for a while before they resume their dispute. The colored patches may be flouted, and in
                                some instances, these antagonistic behaviors resemble courtship rituals.[24]

                                Group-living species tend to be communal group breeders.[24] In addition to these
                                species, a
                                number of species may join mixed-species foraging flocks with other insectivorous birds,
                                although they tend to stay at the edges of these groups. Joining these flocks allows
                                woodpeckers to decrease their anti-predator vigilance and increase their feeding
                                rate.[25]
                                Woodpeckers are diurnal, roosting at night inside holes and crevices. In many species
                                the
                                roost will become the nest-site during the breeding season, but in some species they
                                have
                                separate functions; the grey-and-buff woodpecker makes several shallow holes for
                                roosting
                                which are quite distinct from its nesting site. Most birds roost alone and will oust
                                intruders from their chosen site, but the Magellanic woodpecker and acorn woodpecker are
                                cooperative roosters.[24]</p>

                            <h3>Drumming</h3>
                            <p>Drumming is a form of nonvocal communication used by most species of woodpeckers, and
                                involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a
                                pause, the drum roll is repeated, with each species having a pattern that is unique in
                                the
                                number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between
                                rolls,
                                and the cadence.[26][27] The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the
                                song
                                of a passerine.[28] Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree,
                                and
                                may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes.[29] Drumming serves for the
                                mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual
                                birds
                                are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and those of their
                                neighbors.[30] Drumming can be reliably used to distinguish between multiple species in
                                a
                                region, even if those species are phenotypically similar. Cadence (or the mean number of
                                drum beats per second) is heavily conserved within species.[31] Comparative analyses
                                within
                                species between distant geographic populations have shown that cadence is heavily
                                conserved
                                across species' respective ranges, indicating that there likely are not 'dialects' as
                                seen
                                in passerine song.[32] Drumming in woodpeckers is controlled by a set of nuclei in the
                                forebrain that closely resemble the brain regions that underlie song learning and
                                production
                                in many songbirds.[33] A 2023 study revealed a strong association between extractive
                                foraging and relative brain size across the Family Picidae, indicating that a larger
                                brain
                                does not necessarily result in more powerful drumming abilities, but is implicated in
                                foraging behaviors, as the act of sensing and retrieving wood-boring larvae from woody
                                substrates likely requires an increase in sensory and motor control capabilities.[34]

                            <h3>Calls</h3>
                            <p>Woodpeckers do not have such a wide range of songs and calls as do passerine birds, and
                                the
                                sounds they make tend to be simpler in structure. Calls produced include brief,
                                high-pitched
                                notes, trills, rattles, twittering, whistling, chattering, nasal churrs, screams, and
                                wails.
                                These calls are used by both sexes in communication and are related to the circumstances
                                of
                                the occasion; these include courtship, territorial disputes, and alarm calls. Each
                                species
                                has its own range of calls, which tend to be in the 1.0 to 2.5 kHz range for efficient
                                transmission through forested environments. Mated couples may exchange muted,
                                low-pitched
                                calls, and nestlings often issue noisy begging calls from inside their nest cavity.[28]
                                The
                                wrynecks have a more musical song, and in some areas, the song of the newly arrived
                                Eurasian
                                wryneck is considered to be the harbinger of spring.[35] The piculets either have a song
                                consisting of a long, descending trill, or a descending series of two to six (sometimes
                                more) individual notes, and this song alerts ornithologists to the presence of the
                                birds, as
                                they are easily overlooked.[36]
