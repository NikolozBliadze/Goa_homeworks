            <p>POODLE (which stands for "Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption") is a security vulnerability
                which
                takes advantage of the fallback to SSL 3.0.[1][2][3] If attackers successfully exploit this
                vulnerability,
                on average, they only need to make 256 SSL 3.0 requests to reveal one byte of encrypted messages. Bodo
                MÃ¶ller, Thai Duong and Krzysztof Kotowicz from the Google Security Team discovered this vulnerability;
                they
                disclosed the vulnerability publicly on October 14, 2014 (despite the paper being dated "September
                2014"[1]).[4] On December 8, 2014, a variation of the POODLE vulnerability that affected TLS was
                announced.[5]

                The CVE-ID associated with the original POODLE attack is CVE-2014-3566. F5 Networks filed for
                CVE-2014-8730
                as well, see POODLE attack against TLS section below.</p>

            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>To mitigate the POODLE attack, one approach is to completely disable SSL 3.0 on the client side and the
                server side. However, some old clients and servers do not support TLS 1.0 and above. Thus, the authors
                of the paper on POODLE attacks also encourage browser and server implementation of TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV,[6]
                which will make downgrade attacks impossible.[1][7]

                Another mitigation is to implement "anti-POODLE record splitting". It splits the records into several
                parts and ensures none of them can be attacked. However the problem of the splitting is that, though
                valid according to the specification, it may also cause compatibility issues due to problems in
                server-side implementations.[8]

                A full list of browser versions and levels of vulnerability to different attacks (including POODLE) can
                be found in the article Transport Layer Security.

                Opera 25 implemented this mitigation in addition to TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV.[9]

                Google's Chrome browser and their servers had already supported TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV. Google stated in
                October 2014 it was planning to remove SSL 3.0 support from their products completely within a few
                months.[7] Fallback to SSL 3.0 has been disabled in Chrome 39, released in November 2014.[10] SSL 3.0
                has been disabled by default in Chrome 40, released in January 2015.[11]

                Mozilla disabled SSL 3.0 in Firefox 34 and ESR 31.3, which were released in December 2014, and added
                support of TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV in Firefox 35.[12]

                Microsoft published a security advisory to explain how to disable SSL 3.0 in Internet Explorer and
                Windows OS,[13] and on October 29, 2014, Microsoft released a fix which disables SSL 3.0 in Internet
                Explorer on Windows Vista / Server 2003 and above and announced a plan to disable SSL 3.0 by default in
                their products and services within a few months.[14] Microsoft disabled fallback to SSL 3.0 in Internet
                Explorer 11 for Protect Mode sites on February 10, 2015,[15] and for other sites on April 14, 2015.[16]

                Apple's Safari (on OS X 10.8, iOS 8.1 and later) mitigated against POODLE by removing support for all
                CBC protocols in SSL 3.0,[17][18] however, this left RC4 which is also completely broken by the RC4
                attacks in SSL 3.0.[citation needed] POODLE was completely mitigated in OS X 10.11 (El Capitan 2015) and
                iOS 9 (2015).

                To prevent the POODLE attack, some web services dropped support of SSL 3.0. Examples include
                CloudFlare[19] and Wikimedia.[20]

                Network Security Services version 3.17.1 (released on October 3, 2014) and 3.16.2.3 (released on October
                27, 2014) introduced support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV,[21][22] and NSS will disable SSL 3.0 by default in
                April 2015.[23][needs update] OpenSSL versions 1.0.1j, 1.0.0o and 0.9.8zc, released on October 15, 2014,
                introduced support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV.[24] LibreSSL version 2.1.1, released on October 16, 2014,
                disabled SSL 3.0 by default.[25]</p>
