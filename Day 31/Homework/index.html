                <p>McDonald's Corporation, doing business as McDonald's, is an American multinational fast food chain,
                    founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino,
                    California, United States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand and later turned
                    the company into a franchise, with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in
                    Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and, in
                    1961, bought out the McDonald brothers. Previously headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois, it moved to
                    nearby Chicago in June 2018.[9][10][11][12] McDonald's is also a real estate company through its
                    ownership of around 70% of restaurant buildings and 45% of the underlying land (which it leases to
                    its franchisees).[13][14]

                    McDonald's is the world's largest fast food restaurant chain by number of locations,[15] serving
                    over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries[16] in more than 40,000 outlets as of
                    2021.[17][18] McDonald's is best known for its hamburgers, cheeseburgers and french fries, although
                    their menu also includes other items like chicken, fish, fruit, and salads. Their bestselling
                    licensed item is their french fries, followed by the Big Mac.[19] The McDonald's Corporation
                    revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in
                    company-operated restaurants. McDonald's is the world's second-largest private employer with 1.7
                    million employees (behind Walmart with 2.3 million employees), the majority of whom work in the
                    restaurant's franchises.[20][21]

                    McDonald's has been subject to criticism over the health effects of its products and its
                    participation in various legal cases.</p>

                <p>Siblings Richard and Maurice McDonald opened the first McDonald's at 1398 North E Street at West 14th
                    Street in San Bernardino, California, on May 15, 1940. The brothers introduced the "Speedee Service
                    System" in 1948, putting into expanded use the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant that
                    predecessor White Castle had put into practice more than two decades earlier.[22][23] The original
                    mascot of McDonald's was a hamburger-headed chef who was referred to as "Speedee".[24] In 1962, the
                    Golden Arches replaced Speedee as the universal mascot.[25] Clown mascot Ronald McDonald was
                    introduced in 1963 to market the chain to children.[26]

                    On May 4, 1961, McDonald's first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name "McDonald's" with the
                    description "Drive-In Restaurant Services," which continues to be renewed. By September 13,
                    McDonald's, under the guidance of Ray Kroc, filed for a trademark on a new logoâ€”an overlapping,
                    double-arched "M" symbol. But before the double arches, McDonald's used a single arch for the
                    architecture of their buildings. Although the "Golden Arches" logo appeared in various forms, the
                    present version was not used until November 18, 1968, when the company was granted a U.S. trademark.

                    The present corporation credits its founding to franchised businessman Ray Kroc on April 15,
                    1955.[27][additional citation(s) needed] This was the ninth opened McDonald's restaurant overall,
                    although this location was destroyed and rebuilt in 1984.[clarification needed] Kroc was recorded as
                    being an aggressive business partner, driving the McDonald brothers out of the industry.[28]

                    Kroc and the McDonald brothers fought for control of the business, as documented in Kroc's
                    autobiography. In 1961, he purchased the McDonald brothers' equity in the company and began the
                    company's worldwide reach.[29] The sale cost Kroc $2.7 million, a huge sum during that time.[28] The
                    San Bernardino restaurant was eventually torn down in 1971, and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo
                    chain in 1998. This area serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, and a McDonald's and Route
                    66 museum.[30][31] With the expansion of McDonald's into many international markets, the company has
                    become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life.[32] Its prominence has
                    made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics, and consumer
                    responsibility.</p>

                <p>McDonald's predominantly sells hamburgers, various types of chicken, chicken sandwiches, French
                    fries, soft drinks, shakes, breakfast items, and desserts. In most markets, McDonald's offers salads
                    and vegetarian items, wraps and other localized fare. On a seasonal basis, McDonald's offers the
                    McRib sandwich. Some speculate the seasonality of the McRib adds to its appeal.[33] During March of
                    each year, McDonald's offers a Shamrock Shake to honor Saint Patrick's Day.[34]

                    In addition, the chain also sells some items within the United States on a regional basis; for
                    example, the Hatch Green Chile Double Cheeseburger, which is topped with New Mexico green chile, is
                    only available in the southwestern state of New Mexico.[35][36]

                    Products are offered as either "dine-in" (where the customer opts to eat in the restaurant) or
                    "take-out" (where the customer opts to take the food off the premises). "Dine-in" meals are provided
                    on a plastic tray with a paper insert on the floor of the tray. "Take-out" meals are usually
                    delivered with the contents enclosed in a distinctive McDonald's-branded brown paper bag. In both
                    cases, the individual items are wrapped or boxed as appropriate.

                    Since Steve Easterbrook became CEO of the company in 2015, McDonald's has streamlined the menu which
                    in the United States contained nearly 200 items. The company has looked to introduce healthier
                    options and removed high-fructose corn syrup from hamburger buns. The company has removed artificial
                    preservatives from Chicken McNuggets,[37] replacing chicken skin, safflower oil and citric acid
                    found in Chicken McNuggets with pea starch, rice starch, and powdered lemon juice.[38]

                    In September 2018, McDonald's USA announced that they no longer use artificial preservatives,
                    flavors and colors entirely from seven classic burgers sold in the U.S., including the hamburger,
                    cheeseburger, double cheeseburger, McDouble, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, double Quarter Pounder
                    with Cheese and the Big Mac.[39][40] Nevertheless, the pickles will still be made with an artificial
                    preservative, although customers can choose to opt out of getting pickles with their
                    burgers.[41][42]

                    In November 2020, McDonald's announced McPlant, a plant-based burger, along with plans to develop
                    additional meat alternative menu items that extend to chicken substitutes and breakfast
                    sandwiches.[43][44] This announcement came after the successful testing of Beyond Meat plant based
                    meat substitutes. In late 2022, McDonald's announced the addition of the Double McPlant at all
                    restaurants in the United Kingdom and Ireland starting January 4 due to the success of the
                    McPlant.[45] In 2024, select McDonald's in the UK were testing vegan ice cream called Choco Scoop
                    and Strawberry Scoop and receiving positive reviews.[46]

                    The company often introduces items temporarily or brings them back after long absences.[47][48]</p>
